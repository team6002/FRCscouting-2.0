# 6002 ZooBOTix's scouting script using TBA's & statbotics API's. 
## version 2.0 includes more comments and less unecessary code
Running this script requires a TBA read key from https://thebluealliance.com/account,
in a json file named X-TBA-Auth-Key.json in the format of {"key": "your-TBA-Auth-Key-here"}.

You also need a service account from Google and the credentials from that in a json file called credentials.json
To set up a Google service account, follow these docs: https://support.google.com/a/answer/7378726?hl=en.
The service account will need admin permission and access to the Google sheets API.
